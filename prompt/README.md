## ðŸ§­ Execution Notes for Claude
- Treat each `.txt` file as a standalone module prompt
- Respond with code, logic, and rationale
- Flag interdependencies between modules clearly
- Do not proceed to the next module unless validation criteria are met

---

## ðŸ§ª Next Steps
- Begin with `prompt/01_Project_Overview.txt`
- Use `prompt/README.md` to track module status and decisions
- Validate each module before integration
