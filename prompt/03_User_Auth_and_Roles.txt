Objective:
Implement secure user authentication and role-based access control for:
- Contributors (can add/edit listings and reviews)
- Moderators (can approve/reject content)
- Admins (full access)

Instructions:
- Build login/signup flow with email verification
- Use JWT or session-based auth
- Define middleware or guards for role-based permissions
- Include password reset and basic profile management

Validation:
- Users must be restricted by role
- Contributor actions must be logged
- Moderator dashboard must show pending approvals
