Title: Anonymous User Public Business Directory Access

Objective:
Implement public read-only access to business directory information for anonymous users. Customers should be able to browse all businesses across all categories and view public contact details without requiring registration or login. This provides maximum discoverability while encouraging user registration for enhanced features.

Instructions:
Design and implement a public-facing business directory interface that allows anonymous users to:

1. **Browse All Businesses:**
   - Display complete business listings from all categories
   - Show business names, descriptions, and basic information
   - Include business photos and gallery images
   - Present category classifications and tags

2. **View Public Contact Information:**
   - Display phone numbers, email addresses (if public)
   - Show business addresses and location details
   - Include business hours and availability
   - Present website links and social media profiles

3. **Category Navigation:**
   - Allow browsing businesses by category and subcategory
   - Implement category filtering and sorting options
   - Show business count per category
   - Enable cross-category browsing

4. **Search Functionality:**
   - Provide search by business name, category, or location
   - Include basic filtering options (rating, location, etc.)
   - Display search results with relevant business information
   - Support keyword-based discovery

5. **Read-Only Restrictions:**
   - Disable review submission for anonymous users
   - Hide business management features
   - Show "Register to Review" prompts on business pages
   - Prevent access to user-specific features

6. **Registration Encouragement:**
   - Display clear benefits of registration on relevant pages
   - Show "Login to access more features" messages
   - Include registration call-to-action buttons
   - Highlight premium features available to registered users
