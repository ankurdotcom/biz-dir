Title: AI Prompt Creation and Refinement Workflow

Objective:
Establish a standardized workflow for capturing user input, refining requirements, and converting them into well-structured, AI-compatible prompt formats. This enables consistent prompt creation that follows established patterns and maintains quality standards across all project documentation.

Instructions:
When user says "create prompt", initiate the following workflow:

1. **Capture Phase:**
   - Begin active listening mode for all subsequent user input
   - Record everything the user types verbatim
   - Note context, examples, and specific requirements
   - Continue until user indicates completion

2. **Refinement Phase:**
   - Analyze captured input for clarity and completeness
   - Identify missing elements (title, objective, instructions, etc.)
   - Ask clarifying questions if needed
   - Organize information into logical sections

3. **Structuring Phase:**
   - Convert refined input into standard prompt format:
     * Title: Clear, descriptive heading
     * Objective: Purpose and goal statement
     * Instructions: Step-by-step guidance
     * Validation & Acceptance Criteria: Success metrics
     * Additional sections as needed (Tech Constraints, Core Features, etc.)

4. **File Creation:**
   - Generate appropriate filename using next sequential number
   - Follow naming convention: `##_Descriptive_Title.txt`
   - Save to `/prompt/` directory
   - Update any relevant documentation

Format Standards:
- Use consistent markdown formatting with code blocks
- Keep language clear and actionable
- Include specific, measurable criteria
- Maintain compatibility with existing prompt structure
- Ensure AI tools can easily parse and execute

Validation & Acceptance Criteria:
- Prompt follows established format of existing files
- Title is descriptive and unique
- Objective clearly states the purpose
- Instructions are actionable and specific
- Acceptance criteria are measurable
- File is properly numbered and saved
- Content is AI-compatible and executable

Workflow Triggers:
- User input: "create prompt"
- User input: "new prompt"
- User input: "prompt creation"

Meta Information:
- Created: August 23, 2025
- Purpose: Standardize prompt creation process
- Integration: Works with existing prompt library
- Maintenance: Update format as standards evolve
