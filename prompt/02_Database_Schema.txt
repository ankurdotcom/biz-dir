Title: Core Database Schema for Community Business Directory

Objective:
Design a scalable, normalized database schema to support:
- Town-based business listings
- User roles (contributor, moderator, admin)
- Fractional reviews with comments
- NLP-generated tag cloud
- Sponsored listings and monetization

Instructions:
Create SQL schema or ORM models for the following entities:
1. `User` – ID, name, email, role, reputation score
2. `Town` – ID, name, slug, region
3. `Business` – ID, name, town_id, category, contact info, description, sponsored_flag
4. `Review` – ID, user_id, business_id, rating (float), comment, timestamp
5. `Tag` – ID, business_id, tag_text, weight
6. `ModerationQueue` – ID, content_type, content_id, status, assigned_moderator_id

Validation:
- All foreign keys must be defined
- Use indexing for search-critical fields (e.g., town_id, rating)
- Schema must support future expansion (e.g., premium profiles)
